### Zombie-Tigers-ETL-Project
# DU Bootcamp Group ETL Project

For this project my group Zombie Tigers will be gathering data on national parks. We will be using a Kaggle dataset named Biodiversity in National Parks, a scraped table from https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/visitation-numbers.htm, and some of the numerous APIs from nps.gov. Once the data is extracted, we will clean the data removing extraneous columns and rows. Then we will load the data into a database, it is anticipated we will use MongoDB for this. Finally, we will run an example query and describe some potential options for further analysis based on the combined results.
